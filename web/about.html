	<p>
		Minigames are simple, short video games without a storyline and with a clear objective.
		<br>
		Because of their broad definition, many games can be called mini-games. The first video games,
		 because of the technological limitations of their time, fit this description.
		 
		 <br>The Video Action console produced by Universal Research Laboratories in 1975 allows two or four players to play tennis, football or hockey through adaptations of the game,
		 football or hockey through adaptations of the game Pong. It marked the first compilation of mini-games on one platform. 
		 Arcade games such as Space Invaders (1978) or Pac-Man (1980) popularised the genre on a worldwide scale.
		
		 <br>
		Card games or fairground games such as casino games and rifle shooting lend themselves to being adapted into video games 
		in the form of mini-games because they are easy to play and the rules are familiar to everyone.
		<br>
		The Japanese company Nintendo has produced many games composed of a compilation of mini-games. Either by playing alone as in the WarioWare series (2003), in local multiplayer in the Mario Party or Wii Play series (2007) or network multiplayer for New Super Mario Bros. <br>

		The mini-game genre is characterised by the user-friendly and fun aspect of the games in general as well as their addictive side.</p>

<h2 id="contact" style="color:white"> <center>Because it is our Project</h2></center>
	<p>
		For those who are curious, here is a quick explanation of the objectives of our project and how we went about it.
		<br>
		Firstly, the applications and software used for our project are : Unity, Blender and Firebase.
		<br>
		Unity is a well known and widely used software in video game development. Regarding its handling, many tutorials available on Youtube allowed us to know and master the basics of Unity.
		<br>
	Blender is a software specialized in 3D modeling. This software allowed us to create the whole design part of our game.
	<br>
		And finally, Firbase, which is an application that allows us to store and access our players' data in a totally secure way.
		<br>
		The handling of this software was not an obvious thing and even if we find many very complete tutorials on Youtube, we also had to look at the documentation of these last ones in order to be completely free to realize what we wished.
